<strong>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)</strong> is the core routing protocol that manages how data packets are directed across the internet by exchanging routing and reachability information between different networks or [[Autonomous System]].

# Path Attributes
<strong>BGP</strong> uses <strong>path attributes (PAs)</strong> associated with each network path. 
<strong>BGP routers</strong> evaluate these attributes in a strict, sequential order to prevent routing loops, classify prefixes, and determine the single best path to a network destination.

Every path attribute falls into one of four standard categories based on whether all routers must recognize it and whether it must be passed across different networks.

## Well-known mandatory
Every <strong>BGP-compliant router</strong> <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">must recognize these attributes</mark>, and they <strong>must be included</strong> in every BGP route update message.

## Well-known discretionary 
Every BGP router <strong>must recognize</strong> these attributes, but they are <strong>optional</strong> to include in a route update

## Optional transitive
Routers do not have to recognize these attributes. If a router does not recognize it, it will still <strong>keep the attribute intact and pass it along</strong> to neighboring routers.

## Optional non-transitive
Routers do not have to recognize these attributes. If a router does not recognize it, or if the route crosses into a different network, the attribute is <strong>quietly deleted and not passed forward</strong>.
