Advanced URL Filtering combines Palo Alto Networks <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">malicious URL database capabilities</mark> with the industry’s first <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">real-time web protection engine</mark> powered by deep learning. Now, organizations can automatically detect and prevent new malicious and targeted web-based threats instantly.

Built in the cloud, Advanced URL Filtering is a subscription service that works natively your Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs) to secure networks against web-based threats such as phishing, malware, ransomware, and command and control (C2). 
Advanced URL Filtering uses Palo Alto Networks patent-pending <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">inline deep learning technology</mark> to analyze URLs in real time and classify them into benign or malicious categories, which organizations can easily build into their NGFW policy for total control of web traffic. 
These categories trigger complementary capabilities across the NGFW platform, enabling additional layers of protection, such as targeted SSL decryption and advanced logging. 
Alongside its own analysis, Advanced URL Filtering uses shared threat information from Palo Alto Networks industry-leading malware prevention service, Advanced WildFire and other sources to automatically update protections against malicious sites.
