Advanced URL Filtering combines <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Palo Alto Networks malicious URL database capabilities</mark> with the industry’s first <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">real-time web protection engine powered by deep learning</mark>. Now, <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">organizations can automatically detect and prevent <strong>new</strong> malicious and <strong>targeted web-based threats</strong> instantly</mark>.

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Built in the cloud</mark>, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Advanced URL Filtering is a <strong>subscription service</strong> that works natively your <strong>Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewalls</strong></mark> to secure networks against web-based threats such as phishing, malware, ransomware, and command and control (C2). 

<strong>Advanced URL Filtering</strong> uses Palo Alto Networks patent-pending <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"><strong>inline deep learning technology</strong></mark> <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">to analyze URLs in real time and classify them into benign or malicious categories</mark>, which <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">organizations can easily build into their NGFW policy for total control of web traffic</mark>. 

<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">These categories trigger <u>complementary</u> capabilities across the NGFW platform</mark>, enabling additional layers of protection, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">such as <strong>targeted SSL decryption</strong> and <strong>advanced logging</strong></mark>. 

Alongside its own analysis, <strong>Advanced URL Filtering</strong> uses <strong>shared threat information</strong> from Palo Alto Networks industry-leading malware prevention service, <strong>Advanced WildFire</strong> and other sources to automatically update protections against malicious sites.
