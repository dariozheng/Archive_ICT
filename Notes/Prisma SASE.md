The Palo Alto Networks [[Secure Access Service Edge|SASE]] solution is an public-cloud-delivered [[cloud computing glossary#IaaS|IaaS]] product that combines multiple components in a single converged platform. 
The virtual infrastructure is owned, operated, and maintained by Palo Alto Networks in a single vendor product offering. With each customer with their own isolated data plane. 

The Palo Alto Networks <strong>access solution</strong> for SASE <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">is a virtual network that connects data centers, branches, remote users, and cloud-delivered security over the internet</mark>.

SD-WAN allows secure intelligent application-defined path selection and monitoring over multiple disparate network technologies such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and the internet. 
SD-WAN uses physical or virtual access devices at each location. These are managed by a cloud controller, allowing consistent configuration and rapid changes across the entire fabric.

Palo Alto uses <strong>Autonomous Digital Experience Management</strong> (<strong>ADEM</strong>) to provide a native, end-to-end visibility and performance metrics for real application traffic. 
It is a native element of all key functional areas of the solution. 
The data analytics provided represent the entire network performance simultaneously.

Zero Trust Network Architecture 2.0 is a category of technologies that provides secure remote access to applications and services based on defined access control policies. 

It has been built to secure all users and applications with continuous identity verification based on user behavior. 
Being cloud-based allows this verification to happen at multiple levels across the entire network and ensures that user policies are consistent, improving and simplifying the user experience.
