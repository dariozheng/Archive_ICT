The Palo Alto Networks [[Secure Access Service Edge|SASE]] solution is an public-cloud-delivered [[cloud computing glossary#IaaS|IaaS]] product that combines multiple components in a single converged platform. 
The virtual infrastructure is owned, operated, and maintained by Palo Alto Networks in a single vendor product offering. With each customer with their own isolated data plane. 

The Palo Alto Networks <strong>access solution</strong> for SASE <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">is a virtual network that connects data centers, branches, remote users, and cloud-delivered security over the internet</mark>.

SD-WAN allows secure intelligent application-defined path selection and monitoring over multiple disparate network technologies such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and the internet. 
SD-WAN uses physical or virtual access devices at each location. These are managed by a cloud controller, allowing consistent configuration and rapid changes across the entire fabric.

Palo Alto uses Autonomous Digital Experience Management (ADEM) to provide a native, end-to-end visibility and performance metrics for real application traffic.
