Network scanning is part of the reconnaissance phase of a cyber attack. With the help of <strong>network scanning tools</strong>, attackers can easily scan networks to find vulnerabilities inside them.

They can then use various exploits to attack tre networks and gain complete access to them.

Network scanning, in and of itself, is not an attack; rather, it involves probing a network to identify its weaknesses or vulnerabilities.

However, when an attacker employs network scanning tools, such as <strong>Nmap</strong> and <strong>Nessus</strong>, to gather information for malicious intent, it then constitutes an attack.
