Cloud services are resources not hosted within a corporate infrastructure but managed by a third-party service provider.

Cloud services come in at least three forms:
# Public Cloud
A third-party cloud service provider is responsible for resource maintenance and guarantees availability, reliability, and security through service-level agreements (SLAs). 

The corporation doesn’t buy, own, and maintain any of the public cloud physical data centers and servers; instead, the corporation accesses public cloud services on an as-needed basis. 
In the public cloud, several tasks are typically automated, such as runtime resource scaling.

# Private Cloud
Unlike a public cloud, a private cloud is dedicated to a single tenant or organization. 
A private cloud may be hosted within the organization's data center, in an independent cloud provider's infrastructure, or on rented infrastructure housed in an offsite data center. Additionally, management can range from being internally managed by the organization to being managed by a third party.

# Hybrid Cloud
A hybrid cloud is an integrated IT infrastructure design that appears borderless between a company's public and private clouds. 
Organizations can store data and run applications across on-premises, public, and private clouds without noticing a difference.
