<strong>Device-ID</strong> is a PAN-OS policy construct for enforcement and visibility. 
It allows administrators <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">to apply consistent <strong>policy control</strong> and <strong>threat prevention</strong> to a device</mark> <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">no matter where it <strong>moves</strong> within the network or what its <strong>IP address</strong> is at any given time</mark>. 
<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">The presence of device identity information in firewall logs provides visibility</mark> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">that enables workflows for threat assessment, incident response, and remediation</mark>.

Device-ID operates similarly to how [[User-ID™|User-ID]] provides user-based policy and [[App-ID™|App-ID]] provides app-based policy. 

Device-ID provides traceability for devices and the ability <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">to associate network events with specific devices</mark>. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">It thus allows you to gain context for how events relate to devices</mark> and <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">write policies that are associated with devices</mark>, <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">instead of users, locations, or IP addresses, which can change over time</mark>.
