These environments include private clouds, public and hybrid clouds, software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications, infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) services, and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) environments.
Each application brings its own unique benefits and security issues.

When it comes to IaaS and PaaS, Cloud service providers (CSPs) focus on securing the hardware, operating system, network, and underlying infrastructure services.

  
An organization’s security teams, developers, and DevOps teams are responsible for configuration, user and credential integrity, network and host security, and, importantly, data and application security.
