Windows Remote Management (WinRM) is the Microsoft implementation of the WS-Management protocol, which is a standard Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)-based, firewall-friendly protocol that allows interoperation between hardware and operating systems from different vendors.

The WS-Management protocol specification provides a common way for systems to access and exchange management information across an IT infrastructure. 

WinRM and the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) standard, along with the Event Collector service are components of the set of features known as Hardware management.
