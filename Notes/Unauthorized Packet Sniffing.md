Malicious packet sniffing, or eavesdropping, is a reconnaissance technique where an attacker captures the packets across a wired or wireless connection.

The main goal of packet sniffing is to capture unencrypted traffic to infiltrate data or collect credentials across the network.

Adversaries often sniff common unencrypted protocols, such as HTTP, SMTP, Telnet, and IMAP.
