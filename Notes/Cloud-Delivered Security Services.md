<strong>Cloud-Delivered Security Services</strong> (CDSS) <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">are integrated, subscription-based security solutions hosted in the cloud that protect users, devices, and data anywhere</mark>, moving security from physical appliances to a scalable, always-on platform with real-time threat intelligence, eliminating the need for complex on-premise hardware and manual updates. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">They provide consistent protection across headquarters, branches, remote workers, and multi-cloud environments by consolidating functions like firewall, secure web gateway, and data loss prevention into a single, unified service </mark>.
### Advanced Threat Prevention
The <strong>Advanced Threat Prevention security service</strong> is the industry’s most advanced <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">intrusion prevention system (IPS)</mark> for data centers.
It offers comprehensive prevention of client and server side known exploits, malware, and command-and-control attacks without bogging down network traffic.
### Advanced WildFire
<strong>Advanced WildFire</strong> is the industry's leading <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">malware analysis service</mark>. It automatically analyzes any file-based threat and distributes preventions in seconds or less. 
Advanced WildFire helps security teams stay ahead of unknown and zero-day threats.
### Enterprise Data Loss Prevention
The <strong>Enterprise Data Loss Prevention</strong> (<strong>Enterprise DLP</strong>) <strong>security service</strong> <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">is an enterprise-grade data-security solution that <strong>automatically discovers</strong>, <strong>monitors</strong>, and <strong>protects</strong> sensitive data across data center networks and users</mark>. 
Legacy solutions are complex, inconsistent, costly, and resource-intensive; they require separate cloud-delivered alternatives and lack long-term sustainability. In contrast, the Enterprise DLP service, on average, lowers the total cost of ownership (TCO) by three times
### Advanced URL Filtering
The <strong>Advanced URL Filtering </strong>CDSS is the industry’s first service to provide ML-based inline prevention of malicious domains and phishing. 
URL filtering protects data center users from new and unknown threats and provides safe web and email access for all users.
### IoT Security
Palo Alto Networks <strong>IoT Security service</strong> is the industry’s first turnkey IoT security solution to use machine learning for accurate device discovery, prevention, risk assessment, and native policy enforcement. The IoT Security service helps customers identify, secure, and manage the growing number of otherwise unmanaged IoT and IT devices.
### SD-WAN
Palo Alto Networks <strong>SD-WAN security service</strong> provides secure and reliable SD-WAN that delivers an optimal user experience. The service enables customers to implement software-defined WAN for branches without compromising security.
### GlobalProtect
<strong>GlobalProtect </strong>secures the modern mobile workforce using the capabilities of NGFWs to inspect all traffic and eliminate blind spots. Users can access the network from anywhere, on any device and at any time, but without the complete traffic visibility and control provided by GlobalProtect, endpoint antivirus and VPN technologies cannot stop advanced threats.
### Prisma SaaS
The <strong>Prisma SaaS Security service</strong> enables safer cloud adoption by providing visibility, compliance controls, and security across sanctioned and unsanctioned SaaS applications and associated sensitive data. 
Without this visibility and control, unsanctioned SaaS apps create shadow IT, and even sanctioned SaaS apps can increase the risk of data breaches and noncompliance.
