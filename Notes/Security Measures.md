# Dual-Firewall Configuration
The dual-firewall configuration involves having two dedicated firewalls, one between the DMZ and the Internet and the other between the DMZ and the internal network.
# Application-Layer Firewalls
Application-layer firewalls can be used to inspect the content of traffic passing through the DMZ and other areas of the network that may service devices within the DMZ. This inspection can identify and block malicious traffic, such as malware and phishing attacks targeting DMZ devices and their accompanying services.
# IDS
IDS can be used to monitor devices for suspicious activity. If an IDS detects an attack, it can alert security analysts so that they can take action to mitigate the threat.
# SIEM Systems
SIEM systems can collect and analyze security logs from across the enterprise network. The logs can help to identify and investigate security incidents, such as attacks on devices within the DMZ.
# Regular Patching
It is important to keep all software up to date with the latest security patches. This security measure will help to protect against known vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit.
# Strong Passwords
All users and services should have strong passwords. This protection will make it more difficult for attackers to gain unauthorized access.
# Data Encryption
Any sensitive data that is stored on Enterprise devices should be encrypted. This security measure protects sensitive data from being stolen by attackers.
# Physical Security
Enterprise servers should be physically secured to prevent unauthorized access. This protection includes using locked doors, security cameras, and guards.
