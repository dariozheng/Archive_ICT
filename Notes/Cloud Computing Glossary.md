#### cloud computing 
  paradigm for enabling <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">network access</mark> <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">to a scalable and elastic pool</mark> <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">of shareable physical or virtual resources</mark> <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">with self-service provisioning</mark> and administration on demand.
#### on premise 
refers to <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">private data centers</mark> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">that companies house in their own facilities and maintain themselves</mark>. On-prem infrastructure can be used to run private clouds, in which compute resources are virtualized in much the same way as those of public clouds (however, private clouds can also be run on leased third-party hardware).
#### cloud-based
(of digital data) stored, managed, and processed on a network of remote servers hosted on the internet, rather than on local servers or personal computers.
#### compute
it refers to the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">on-demand</mark>, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"><strong>virtualized</strong> processing power</mark> (<strong>CPU</strong>, <strong>RAM</strong>, <strong>GPUs</strong>) and <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">resources</mark> needed to run applications, process data, and perform tasks, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;"><strong>delivered</strong> over the internet</mark> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">instead of using your own physical servers</mark>.
#### IaaS
<strong>Infrastructure as a service</strong> (IaaS) provides <strong>on-demand</strong> access to fundamental computing resources—physical and virtual servers, networking and storage—over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis.
#### PaaS
<strong>Platform as a service</strong> (PaaS) provides a complete <strong>on-demand</strong> cloud platform (<strong>hardware</strong>, <strong>software</strong> and <strong>infrastructure</strong>) for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">developing, running, maintaining and managing applications</mark>. 
The PaaS provider hosts everything—including servers, networks, data storage, operating system (OS) software, databases and development tools—at their data center.
#### SaaS
<strong>Software as a service</strong> (SaaS) is cloud-hosted application software delivered over the internet to compatible computing devices. 
SaaS providers <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">operate, manage and maintain the software and the infrastructure on which it runs</mark>. Instead of buying application software and installing on a local device, SaaS users simply create an account, subscribe to the application and get to work.
#### FWaaP
<strong>Firewall as a platform</strong> (FWaaP) is a cloud-based firewall solution that provides network security capabilities through a subscription model.
Unlike traditional firewalls, FWaaS operates in the cloud, offering features such as traffic inspection, threat prevention, and application control without the need for on-premises hardware.
#### instance network interface 
is a <strong>virtual network card </strong>attached to a compute instance (virtual machine), acting as its point of connection to a virtual network (VPC). 
It holds essential network info (IP addresses, MAC address, security groups):
- **AWS**: Elastic Network Interface (ENI)
- **Azure**: Network Interface (NIC)
- **Google Cloud**: Network Interface
- **OCI (Oracle)**: VNIC
