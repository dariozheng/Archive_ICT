#### cloud computing
a paradigm for enabling network access to a scalable and elastic pool of shareable physical or virtual resources with self-service provisioning and administration on demand.
#### on premise 
 refers to private data centers that companies house in their own facilities and maintain themselves. On-prem infrastructure can be used to run private clouds, in which compute resources are virtualized in much the same way as those of public clouds (however, private clouds can also be run on leased third-party hardware).
