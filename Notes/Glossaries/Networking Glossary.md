#### software-defined network
<strong>Software-Defined Network (SDN)</strong> infrastructure <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">centralizes network control in software</mark>, separating it from hardware (routers/switches), <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">creating a virtualized, programmable network</mark> <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">managed via a central controller and APIs for agility, automation, and easier management</mark>, allowing dynamic traffic steering and policy enforcement across physical and virtual environments. 
#### SD-WAN
SD-WAN (Software-Defined Wide Area Network) is a networking approach that uses <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">software</mark> to <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">manage and optimize connectivity across different locations</mark> (like <strong>branches</strong>, <strong>data centers</strong>, <strong>cloud</strong>) <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">over various transport links (<strong>MPLS</strong>, <strong>broadband</strong>, <strong>LTE</strong>)</mark>, <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">simplifying management, improving performance, and reducing costs compared to traditional hardware-centric WANs</mark>. <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">It centralizes control</mark>, creating a virtual network overlay for dynamic, policy-based traffic steering to ensure the best path for applications. 
#### backhaul 
Backhaul refers to the part of your network that carries data from the access layer to a central location (such as a data center). Edge devices like access points, switches, routers, branch offices, and remote equipment all depend on backhaul to reach the main network or the internet.
