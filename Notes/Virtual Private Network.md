A VPN creates a secure, encrypted connection (or tunnel) across the internet between two endpoints. A client VPN establishes a secure connection between a user and an organization's network. A site-to-site VPN establishes a secure connection between two organizations' networks, usually geographically separated.

VPN client software is typically installed on mobile endpoints, such as laptop computers and smartphones, to extend a network beyond the physical boundaries of the organization.

The VPN client connects to a VPN server, such as a firewall, router, or VPN appliance (or concentrator). After a VPN tunnel is established, a remote user can access network resources, such as file servers, printers, and Voice over IP (VoIP) phones, as if they were physically in the office.
